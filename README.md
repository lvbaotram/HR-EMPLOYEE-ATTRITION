# INTRODUCTION
Employee attrition, or turnover, is a critical issue that affects organizations across various industries. High attrition rates can lead to increased recruitment costs, loss of organizational knowledge, and decreased overall productivity. As a result, it is essential for companies to understand the factors contributing to employee attrition to develop effective strategies for retaining talent.

This project involves analyzing employee attrition data using SQL to uncover patterns and insights that can help an organization better understand why employees leave. By examining key factors such as gender, salary, job satisfaction, travel requirements, and department, the analysis aims to identify the major drivers of attrition and suggest actionable recommendations for improving employee retention.
